TODO:

- [x] Instantiate method references. They should have fresh variables that are
  constrained to the protocol.
- [x] Make sure the Scheme gets all the constraints in an expression.
- [ ] Use Polymorphic.Type instead of TVarBinding as parameter in protocol
      head.
- [ ] Substitute all type variables in protocols and constraints.
