# Oden Programming Language (NO LONGER IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/oden-lang/oden.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/oden-lang/oden)

Oden is an **experimental**, statically typed, functional programming language,
built for the Go ecosystem. It aims to leverage the great features of Go —
static linking, cross-compilation, goroutines, channels and the great set
of libraries and tools — and enable higher-level abstractions, generics
and a safer yet more flexible type system.

## Documentation

Details about the project, how to install and run the compiler and how to
program in Oden is located at http://oden-lang.github.io/.

For build instructions see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).
