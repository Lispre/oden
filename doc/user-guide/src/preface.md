# Preface

Welcome to the Oden User Guide. Here you can learn about *The Oden
Programming Language* - an experimental, statically typed, functional
programming language, built for the Go ecosystem.

This guide assumes that you as a reader have a basic knowledge of at least one
mainstream programming languages, be it functional, procedural, object-oriented,
or something else. You do not have to know anything about functional
programming to read this book, nor do you have to know the Go programming
language.
