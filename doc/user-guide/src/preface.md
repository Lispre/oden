# Preface

Welcome to the Oden User Guide. Here you can learn about *The Oden
Programming Language* - an experimental, statically typed, functional
programming language, built for the Go ecosystem.

This guide assumes that you as a reader have a basic knowledge of at least one
mainstream programming language, be it functional, procedural,
object-oriented, or something else. You do not have to be an expert in
functional programming to read this guide, nor do you have to know the Go
programming language. Some advanced concepts, not specific to Oden,
are only touched upon briefly. You are encouraged to follow the references
in the end of the guide to learn more.
